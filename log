Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:

In the dependencies for comonad-5.0.8:
    distributive must match >=0.5.2 && <1, but the stack configuration has no specified version  (latest matching version is 0.6.2.1)
    indexed-traversable must match >=0.1.1 && <0.2, but the stack configuration has no specified version  (latest matching version is 0.1.1)
    transformers-compat must match >=0.5 && <1, but the stack configuration has no specified version  (latest matching version is 0.7)
needed due to warpt3-0.1.0.0 -> comonad-5.0.8

Some different approaches to resolving this:

  * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps in /home/yuri/Jura/prog/haskell/warpt3/stack.yaml:

- distributive-0.6.2.1@sha256:0f99f5541cca04acf89b64432b03422b6408e830a8dff30e6c4334ef1a48680c,2996
